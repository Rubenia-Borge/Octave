% Initialize a 3 by 2 matrix 

A = [1, 2; 3, 4;5, 6]

C = [11, 12; 13, 14; 15, 16]



% Initialize a 2 by 1 matrix 

B = [1; 2] 

D = [11; 12]

% We expect a resulting matrix of (3 by 2)*(2 by 1) = (3 by 1) 

mult_AB = A*B

mult_CD = C*D



% Make sure you understand why we got that result
